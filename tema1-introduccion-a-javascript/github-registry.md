## About GitHub Packages

* [About GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages)

You need an access token to publish, install, and delete packages in GitHub Packages. You can use a personal access token to authenticate with your username directly to GitHub Packages or the GitHub API. You can use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate using a GitHub Actions workflow.

When you create a personal access token, you can assign the token different scopes depending on your needs. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)" and "[Available scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes)" in the GitHub Developer documentation.
